The route breaks from Route 28 at mile 7, rolling up the beautiful New Kingston Valley and beginning a steady climb at the hamlet and up over the pass (15.6 mi.) to Bovina. Bovina Center offers a refreshment stop before the scenic ascent of Pink Street and then its steep, fast plunge into the West Branch Valley. Rolling downstream, the ride crosses the covered bridge (34.7) and soon continues up picturesque Elk Creek Road (from previous years’ routes), before traversing the Catskill Turnpike west. \n",

To get to the bridge, continue straight ahead for 1 mile then left for .4 mile.)  From DeLancey, riders will tackle a 1050’ gain in the next 7.5 miles to the apex of Co. Rte. 2, high above Andes with spectacular views. Reaching Andes at mile 76, the route rolls down the Tremperskill Valley, with a refreshment stop just before the bridge that carries you over the Pepacton Reservoir (84.5). Much of the concluding stretch follows the shore of the Pepacton and is flat to rolling. Recommended for advanced level cyclists. \n",
